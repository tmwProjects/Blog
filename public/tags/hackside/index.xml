      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share with you how I created HackSide with the help of Hugo. My adventure began on a rainy day when I&#xA;decided to turn my ideas and technical skills into a unique digital project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My journey was a fascinating mix of creativity and technical challenge. I came across Hugo and was immediately impressed&#xA;by its simplicity and efficiency. It was like discovering a new tool that was tailored to my exact needs. The beauty of&#xA;Hugo is that it is written in Go, a language known for its speed and power. This made the whole process not only faster,&#xA;but also more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
