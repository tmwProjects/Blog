Hello and nice to have you here!

**HackSide** is my personal space in the digital universe, a diary of my thoughts, projects and learning processes. This blog 
is my outlet, my tool to create clarity in my head and process my experiences. Every post is a part of my journey, a piece 
of the puzzle in my continuous learning process.

This is where I share what moves and engages me, in the hope that it will also become an educational archive of my journey 
for myself. From technical experiments to personal reflections, every page of this blog is a reflection of my love of 
discovery and my desire to keep growing.

This space is primarily for me, a journal of my thoughts and projects. If you choose to be part of this journey by reading 
my posts, I'd love your company.

In the simplicity of this blog lies my way of understanding myself and my projects and learning a little more every day.
