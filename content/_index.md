Hello and nice to have you here!

**HackSide** is my personal space in the digital universe, a diary of my thoughts, projects and learning processes. This blog 
is my outlet, my tool to create clarity in my head and process my experiences. Every post is a part of my journey, a piece 
of the puzzle in my continuous learning process.

This is where I share what moves and engages me, in the hope that it will also become an educational archive of my journey 
for myself. From technical experiments to personal reflections, every page of this blog is a reflection of my love of 
discovery and my desire to keep growing.

This space is primarily for me, a journal of my thoughts and projects. If you choose to be part of this journey by reading 
my posts, I'd love your company.

In the simplicity of this blog lies my way of understanding myself and my projects and learning a little more every day.

**HackSide** follows the principle that everyone is welcome, regardless of appearance, age, origin, species, gender, social 
status, physical or mental abilities, or any other personal characteristics. We do not judge anyone based on these 
characteristics. If you share this inclusive philosophy, don't hesitate to get in touch. Even if your views differ, you 
are welcome to contact us, although it may be difficult to find a common consensus.

All posts are licensed under the **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** and each is marked with a shield, as well as an 
alternative catchy description at the end of each post what this license basically says.

If you value what I share here and want to support me, you have the opportunity to make a contribution,
big or small. Sharing **HackSide**, making a donation, noticing and reporting errors/bugs/exploits, ideas for topics or
use my posts for your own work allows me to continue to dedicate myself to my projects and to further 
expand them.

Thank you very much for your support!
