# Context

As part of a **Data Engineering course**, I’m currently exploring **Apache Spark** in depth – a powerful framework for distributed data processing in the Big Data ecosystem. This interactive mind map serves as a **visual summary** of the key concepts, components, and application areas of Spark – both to reinforce my own learning and to act as a compact reference guide.

The mind map was created using **Markmap**, a tool that transforms Markdown structures into interactive mind maps. You can navigate and use the map as follows:

## Mindmap Usage & Features

- **Expand/Collapse Nodes**: Click on a node with an arrow to show or hide its subtopics.  
- **Zoom & Pan**: Use your mouse or touch gestures to zoom in/out and move around the map.  
- **Fullscreen View**: Right-clicking on the map or using the menu (depending on the Markmap setup) may allow fullscreen display.  
- **Linked Elements**: Some nodes contain links to documentation or external resources – simply click to follow.

> **Note**: This mind map doesn’t cover *all* topics, but it’s more than enough for an initial deep dive. I’ve kept it in **German** because it made managing my notes easier during the learning process.

For my long-term, **networked learning**, I’ve since switched to using **Obsidian** with its **graph view**, which allows me to organize and access notes quickly across different projects.
